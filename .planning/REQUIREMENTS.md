# Requirements: Agent Deck Skills Reorganization & Stabilization

**Defined:** 2026-03-06
**Core Value:** Skills must load correctly and trigger reliably when sessions start or on demand

## v1 Requirements

### Skills Reformatting

- [x] **SKILL-01**: Agent-deck skill uses official skill-creator format with proper SKILL.md frontmatter, scripts/, and references/ directories
- [x] **SKILL-02**: Session-share skill uses official skill-creator format with proper SKILL.md frontmatter and scripts/
- [ ] **SKILL-03**: GSD conductor skill is properly packaged in ~/.agent-deck/skills/pool/gsd-conductor/ with up-to-date content
- [x] **SKILL-04**: All skill SKILL.md files have correct frontmatter (name, description, compatibility fields)
- [ ] **SKILL-05**: Skill script path resolution works correctly from both plugin cache and local development paths

### Testing

- [ ] **TEST-01**: Sleep/wake detection correctly transitions session status (running -> idle -> running on activity)
- [ ] **TEST-02**: Skills trigger correctly when referenced in session context or loaded on demand
- [ ] **TEST-03**: Session start creates tmux session and transitions to running status
- [ ] **TEST-04**: Session stop cleanly terminates tmux session and updates status
- [ ] **TEST-05**: Session fork creates independent copy with correct instance ID propagation
- [ ] **TEST-06**: Session attach connects to existing tmux session without errors
- [ ] **TEST-07**: Session status tracking reflects actual tmux session state accurately

### Stabilization

- [ ] **STAB-01**: All bugs discovered during testing are fixed
- [ ] **STAB-02**: `golangci-lint run` passes with zero warnings
- [ ] **STAB-03**: `go test -race ./...` passes with zero failures
- [ ] **STAB-04**: `go build` succeeds for all target platforms (darwin/linux, amd64/arm64)
- [ ] **STAB-05**: Dead code and stale artifacts removed from codebase
- [ ] **STAB-06**: CHANGELOG.md updated with all changes

## v2 Requirements

### Skills Ecosystem

- **SKILL-06**: Pool skill auto-discovery (list available pool skills from TUI)
- **SKILL-07**: Skill versioning and update mechanism
- **SKILL-08**: Skill dependency resolution

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| New agent-deck features | This milestone is reorganization and stabilization only |
| CI/CD pipeline changes | Local release process is sufficient |
| Version bump | Deferred until work is assessed |
| Skills for other tools (Gemini, etc.) | Focus on Claude Code skills only |

## Traceability

| SKILL-01 | Phase 1 | Complete |

| SKILL-03 | Phase 1 | Pending |
